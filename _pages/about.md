Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master of Computing student at [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg), specializing in Computer Science. In 2025, I received my B.Eng degree in Computer science from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](http://www.bupt.edu.cn).

Currently, I am completing my Master's dissertation at the [Acoustic Research Laboratory (ARL)](https://arl.nus.edu.sg) at NUS, supervised by [Prof. Mandar Chitre](http://www.chitre.net) and [Dr. Matthias Hoffmann-Kuhnt](https://arl.nus.edu.sg/people/matthias-hoffmann-kuhnt/). I also work closely with [Prof. Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/) for my undergraduate FYP and Master Project. My research focuses on **analyzing dolphin bioacoustics using machine learning techniques**, aiming to decode information from dolphin clicks for advanced applications.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing, hanging out with friends, photography, Model United Nations, and doing Duolingo. I hope to spare more time at concerts, sharpen her badminton skills, and squeeze in a few extra rounds of Splatoon.
